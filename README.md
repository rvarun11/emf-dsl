# DSL with EMF 

Built a domain-specific language called _festFair_ using the Eclipse Modelling Framework.

- Emfatic was used for metamodelling.
- Eugenia was used to build the graphical editor for the metamodel.
- Epsilon Validation Language (EVL) was used to add validation constraints to the metamodel.
- Epsilon Generation Language (EGL) was used for model transformation.
